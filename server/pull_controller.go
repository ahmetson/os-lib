/*
Package server defines the data type of the various server sockets.

Using the server package, you can turn application to the servers.

The following types of controllers are supported:

  - Pull creates a puller for the service. Puller enables the inputs, but doesn't respond back.
  - Reply creates a replier for the service. Reply executes the messages and replies back to the caller.
  - Router creates a proxy/broker for the service. Router forwards the requests to other Router/Reply or Pull
