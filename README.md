# Service Lib

Here is the reference to the SDS first.

After reading this README, read the specific
references for each type of services

* [Proxy](./PROXY.md) to define proxy services.
* [Extension](./EXTENSION.md) to define extension services.
* [Independent](./INDEPENDENT.md) to define independent services.

## What is SDS?
SDS connects all developers by making all APIs 
in the world inter-changeable. 

SDS itself gives a single account, 
a payment solution for them. 

With SDS, the developers can manage the invoices for APIs in a single place.

Discover the services on SDS Hub. 
If it doesn't exist, create it using **Service Lib** and publish for others.

### Service
A **service** is a solution for a one problem as an independent
software. An **app** is an interconnection of the services. 

> Since services are independent software, then, an **app** 
will be considered as a distributed system.

> Single service itself also acts as an **app**. Here, we just refer as **app**
> to the specific business case of your need.



The services are created using **Service Lib**. 
The goal of **Service Lib** is to write re-usable solutions that will be
useful to another project with a minimal setup. Hence, why the services are
standalone applications .

To compose an app from the services in a structured way, the services are
divided into three categories.

#### Independent
The first type of the services are **independent** services. Read it
as an independent software. Your app should have one independent service
that keeps the core logic of your application.

Independent services will rarely be shared. So the source
code could be private.

#### Extension
The second type of the services are **extension** services. The extensions
are the solutions that could be re-used by multiple projects.

This is the core part that all makes the services as re-usable.

The extensions are allowed to be connected from the independent services.
And doesn't work with the users directly.

#### Proxy
The third and last type of the services are **proxy** services. The proxy
acts as a switch between a user/service and a user/service. Depending on 
the proxy result the request will be forwarded or returned back to the client.

### Controller
Since the services are the units of distributed system, services
has to talk to each other. And services has to talk with the external world.

Therefore, each service acts as a server. The service mechanism 
transfers in or out some messages. 
This mechanism is implemented through controllers.

> Controller is an alias of server.
> 
> Controller term comes from the MPC pattern.

A service may have multiple controllers, at least one. 
The controllers receive the messages. Then controller is routing
the messages to the handlers. To find the right handler, the messages 
include the commands.

For optimization needs, there are different kinds of controllers.

#### Replier
A **replier** controller handles a one request at a time. All incoming
requests are queued internally, until the current request is not executed.
When the request is executed, the controller returns the status to the callee.
Then replier will execute the next request in the queue.

> The requester will be waiting the response of the controller

#### Router
A **router** controller handles many requests at a time. Upon the execution,
the router will reply the status back to the callee.

> The requester will be waiting the response of the controller

#### Puller
A **puller** controller handles a one request at a time. All requests will be
queued internally. When the controller finishes the execution, it will
execute the next request in the queue.

Puller will not respond back to the callee about the status.

> The requester will not wait for the response of the controller.
> So this one is faster.

#### Publisher
A **publisher** controller sends messages to the subscribers. It doesn't
receive the request from outside. But has internal **puller** controller
that the **publisher** is connected too. Any message coming into the **puller**
invokes mass message broadcast by the **publisher**.

> The subscriber waits for the controller, but doesn't request to the publisher.
> The invoker of the puller doesn't wait for the response of the publisher.

### Service building checklist
* Define the type of the service
* Define the controllers
* Define commands
* Define the handlers for each commands
* Add the handlers to the controllers
* Add the controllers to the service
* If the command require another service, then define the extensions
* Create a configuration with: service, controllers and extensions.
* If the service should be behind the proxy, then add the proxy to configuration

### App building checklist
* Create a configuration
* Define the independent service
* Define the controllers of the independent service
* Define the extensions
* If the independent service needs, add the proxy

## Configuration
Any apps created by this module is loading environment
variables by default.

As well as it requires the *configuration* in yaml format.

You can set the Yaml file name as well as it's path
using the following environment variables:
```bash
SERVICE_CONFIG_NAME=service
SERVICE_CONFIG_PATH=.
```

By default, the service will look for `service.yml` in the `.` directory.

The configuration format is this:
```yaml
Services:
  - Type: Independent # or Proxy | Extension
    Name: 
    Instance: 
    Controllers:
      - Type: Replier # or Puller | Publisher | Router
        Name: "myApi"
        Instances:
          - Port: 2302
            Instance: 
    Proxies:
      - Name: "auth"
        Port: 8000

    Pipelines:
      - "auth->myApi"

    Extensions:
      - Name: "database"
        Port: 8002
```

At root, it has `Services` with at least one Service defined.
The service has the following parameters:

* Type which defines what kind of service it is. It could be `Independent`, `Proxy` or `Extension`.
* Name of the service. If you define multiple services, then their Type and Name should match.
* Instance is the unique identifier of this service. If you have multiple services, then it should have different instance.
* Controllers lists what kind of command handlers it has.
* Proxies lists what kind of proxies it has.
* Pipelines should have one or more proxy pipeline. The last name should name of the controller instance.
* Extensions lists the extensions that this service depends on. All these extensions are passed to the controllers.

The **controllers** are the command handlers. All incoming requests
from the users (whether it's through proxy or not) are handled by the controllers.
The parameters of the controllers:
* Type which defines what kind of controller it is. It could be Replier, Puller, Publisher or Router.
* Name of the controller to classify it.
* Instances describes the unique controllers of this type.

The controller instances have the following parameters:
* Instance is the unique id of the controller within all service
* Port where the controller exposes itself

Proxy has the following parameters:
* Name of the proxy
* Port where the proxy set too.

Extension has the following parameters:
* Name of the extension
* Port where the extension set too.
